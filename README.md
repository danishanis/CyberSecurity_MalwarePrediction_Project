Cyber security - Microsoft Malware Prediction

## Aim

This project aims to analyze Microsoftâ€™s Malware Prediction dataset from Kaggle using a Binary Classifier developed in Apache Spark. The objective is to be able to predict whether a malware can occur in a device or not based on the provided features. A logistic regression algorithm was developed for the purpose, and its classification performance was compared with other supervised learning algorithms like Gradient Boosting and Random Forest. 

Additionally, the overall performance of the system was enhanced by efficient feature engineering, grid search and cross validation. As a metric for model performance evaluation, area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was used to discriminate between models.
